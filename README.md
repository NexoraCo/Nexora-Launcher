## Info / About Nexora Launcher

Nexora Launcher is a lightweight, all-in-one game launcher for indie games. It is built to provide a clean, fast, and modular experience for managing and launching games without bloat or unnecessary telemetry.

**How it was made:**
- **Language & Framework:** C# with .NET 8
- **UI Framework:** WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- **Architecture:** MVVM pattern for clear separation of UI, logic, and data
- **Installer System:** NSIS with user-level, admin-level, and portable modes
- **Game Data:** JSON-based database for easy backup, sync, and editing
- **Update System:** GitHub Releases integration planned for automatic updates

**Purpose:**
- Demonstrates a modern launcher architecture for indie games
- Provides a foundation for real integrations with platforms like Steam, Epic, and GitHub
- Serves as a prototype for UI/UX evaluation and architecture testing

**Current Limitations:**
- Real game library scanning and launching are not implemented
- Store integrations and cloud sync are not available yet
- This release is primarily for testing installer, architecture, and design

This README and Info section are designed to give developers and testers a clear understanding of the launcher’s structure, purpose, and capabilities.
